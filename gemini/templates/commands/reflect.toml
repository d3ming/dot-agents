Step 1: Reflect on our conversation history. Identify recurring themes, friction points, or instances where I (the agent) required too much guidance or made suboptimal assumptions.

Step 2: Evaluate my performance against the existing global and project-level GEMINI.md rules. Did I follow them? Did they fail to cover a specific scenario we encountered?

Step 3: Propose 1-3 concrete, actionable additions or modifications to the current project's GEMINI.md file.
- If the project doesn't have a local GEMINI.md, suggest a new one based on what you've learned about this project's stack and conventions.
- If we are in a meta-context (like the .gemini config folder), suggest improvements to the global GEMINI.md.

The goal is to evolve our working protocol based on real-world friction. Be direct, technical, and critical.
