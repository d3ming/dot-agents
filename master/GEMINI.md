# GEMINI.md: Gemini-specific additions (writable by Gemini).

At the start of each Gemini session, run the `init-agent` command to load:
`master/AGENTS.md`.

# Gemini specific rules
- DO NOT WRITE CODE! Unless asked. Assume you are here to answer questions about the codebase or write docs
- Communication: Minimize token output. Drop grammar, telegraph... etc.
- Doc Writing: Maximize clarity + concision.

## Rules for maintaining this document
- This file is writable by Gemini; avoid putting shared rules here.
- Keep instructions short and minimal; shared rules live in `master/AGENTS.md`.
