  Findings

  - [P1] Conflicting/incorrect ignoreCommand guidance in docs — docs/onboarding/vercel-deployment.md:60-90 vs docs/onboarding/vercel-
    deployment.md:277-296. The file now documents two different configs. The later “Recommended” block (git diff HEAD^ HEAD --quiet .)
    contradicts the earlier multi‑path config and the actual web/capital-app/vercel.json. If someone follows the later block, they’ll
    stop deploying on src/capital, src/folib, and data/* changes, re‑introducing the original bug.
  - [P1] Task tracking/plan workflow is inconsistent and references a non‑existent plan — TASKS.md:5, ai/skills/task-planning/
    SKILL.md:1-19, ai/skills/task-planning/PLAN-SKILLS.md:4-6. The task links to implementation-vercel-monorepo-deployment.md which
    doesn’t exist, and the skill docs still point to docs/plans/docs/-tasks while the new workflow says _plans/TASKS.md / TASKS.md.
    This violates the repo’s “plan must be linked before implementation” rule and will confuse agents.
  - [P2] ignoreCommand only diffs HEAD^..HEAD — web/capital-app/vercel.json:3. If multiple commits are pushed at once and the last
    commit doesn’t touch tracked paths, Vercel will skip the build even if earlier commits did. Consider diffing from the previous
    deployed SHA (e.g. VERCEL_GIT_PREVIOUS_SHA) to avoid missing real changes.
